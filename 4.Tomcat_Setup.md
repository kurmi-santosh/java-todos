# Tomcat installation on EC2 instance

### Pre-requisites
1. EC2 instance with Java 11

### Install Apache Tomcat
1. Download tomcat packages from  https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi onto /opt on EC2 instance
   > Note: Make sure you change `<version>` with the tomcat version which you download.
   ```sh 
   # Create tomcat directory
   cd /opt
   wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.80/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.80.tar.gz
   tar -xvzf /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.80.tar.gz
   
   mv apache-tomcat-9.0.80 tomcat
   ```
2. Give executing permissions to startup.sh and shutdown.sh which are under bin.
   ```sh
   chmod +x /opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh 
   chmod +x /opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh
   ```
   > Note: you may get below error while starting tomcat incase if you dont install Java   
   `Neither the JAVA_HOME nor the JRE_HOME environment variable is defined At least one of these environment variable is needed to run this program`
3. Create link files for tomcat startup.sh and shutdown.sh
   ```sh
   ln -s /opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcatup
   ln -s /opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcatdown
   
   tomcatup
   
   ```
#### Check point :
access tomcat application from browser on port 8080
- http://<Public_IP>:8080

Using unique ports for each application is a best practice in an environment. But tomcat and Jenkins runs on ports number 8080. Hence lets change tomcat port number to 8090. Change port number in conf/server.xml file under tomcat home
   ```sh
 cd /opt/tomcat/conf
# update port number in the "connecter port" field in server.xml
# restart tomcat after configuration update
tomcatdown
tomcatup
```
#### Check point :
Access tomcat application from browser on port 8090
- http://<Public_IP>:8090

1. now application is accessible on port 8090. but tomcat application doesnt allow to login from browser. changing a default parameter in context.xml does address this issue
   ```sh
   #search for context.xml
   find / -name context.xml
   ```
1. Above command gives below context.xml files. 
   Comment (<!-- & -->) `Value ClassName` field on files which allow only localhost.

   After that restart tomcat services to effect these changes.
   At the time of writing this lecture below 2 files are updated.
   ```sh 
   /opt/tomcat/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml
   /opt/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
   
   # Restart tomcat services
   tomcatdown  
   tomcatup
   ```
3. Update users information in the tomcat-users.xml file
      goto tomcat home directory and Add below users to conf/tomcat-users.xml file
      ```sh
       <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
       <role rolename="manager-script"/>
       <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
       <role rolename="manager-status"/>
       <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, manager-script, manager-jmx, manager-status"/>
       <user username="deployer" password="deployer" roles="manager-script"/>
       <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui"/>
      ```
1. Restart serivce and try to login to tomcat application from the browser. This time it should be Successful
