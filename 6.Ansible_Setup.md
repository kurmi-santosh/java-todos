# Ansible Installation

Ansible is an open-source automation platform, works as a deployment tool. 

### Pre-requisites

1. An AWS EC2 instance (on Control node)

### Installation steps:

#### on Amazon EC2 instance


1. Install ansible using pip check for version
    ```sh
    amazon-linux-extras install ansible2
    ansible --version
   ```

2. Create a user called ansadmin (on Control node and Managed host)
   ```sh
   useradd ansadmin
   passwd ansadmin
   ```
3. Below command grant sudo access to ansadmin user.
   But we strongly recommended using nano editor.  (on Control node and Managed host)
   ```sh
   echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
   ```

4. Log in as a ansadmin user on master and generate ssh key (on Control node)
   ```sh 
   sudo su - ansadmin
   ssh-keygen
   ```
5. Copy keys onto all ansible managed hosts (on Control node)
   ```sh 
   ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<target-server>
   ```

6. Ansible server used to create images and store on docker registry. Hence install docker, start docker services and add ansadmin to the docker group.
   ```sh
   yum install docker
   
   # start docker services 
   service docker start
   service docker start 
   
   # add user to docker group 
   usermod -aG docker ansadmin

   ```
7.  An inventory file called "hosts" add control node and managed hosts IP addresses is available at etc/ansible/hosts.
    Add managed nodes and controlled nodes IP address

### Validation test

1. Run ansible command as ansadmin user it should be successful (Master)
   ```sh 
   ansible all -m ping
   
   ansible all -a uptime
   ```

# Ansible Playbooks

Playbooks are set of instructions we want to execute. We will be creating two playbooks:

1. To create an image, and push to hub/artifactory

```sh
--- 
- hosts: ansible
  
  tasks:
  - name: Create docker image
    command: docker build -t todos-image:latest .
    args:
     chdir: /opt/docker
  
  - name: Create tag to push image onto hub
    command: docker tag todos-image:latest kurmi/todos-image:latest

  - name: Push docker image
    command: docker push kurmi/todos-image:latest
```

2. To pull the image from hub, and create container and deploy the application

```sh
---
- hosts: dockerhost
  
  tasks: 
  - name: Stop existing container 
    command: docker stop todos-server
    ignore_errors: yes

  - name: Remove the container
    command: docker rm todos-server
    ignore_errors: yes

  - name: Remove the image
    command: docker rmi kurmi/todos-image:latest
    ignore_errors: yes

  - name: Create container
    command: docker run -d --name todos-server -p 8081:8080 kurmi/todos-image:latest

```
